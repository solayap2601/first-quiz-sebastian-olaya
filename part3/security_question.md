### Based on the OWASP Top 10, these would be the security considerations for each aspect:

- Access Control Loss
 Someone can access things they shouldn’t, such as viewing or changing other users’ data or using functions that don’t correspond to them. To prevent this, permissions and roles for each type of user should be used, and they should be authenticated with a secure identity provider.

- Cryptographic Failures 
The data sent or stored is not protected, and someone could read or modify it. To prevent this, encryption should be used for sensitive data, both when it is sent and when it is stored.

- Injection
This means that someone can send malicious data that runs in the app, such as SQL code, programming code, or HTML code. To prevent this, the data received from users should be validated and cleaned, and parameterized queries should be used for the database. Also, the use of components that may be vulnerable to injection should be avoided, and XSS in the web frontend should be prevented.

- Insecure Design
The app is not designed to be secure from the start and has flaws or weaknesses that can be exploited. To prevent this, secure design principles such as defense in depth, least privilege, and security by default should be followed.

- Misconfiguration
The app has options or parameters that are not configured securely and can leave open doors for attackers. To prevent this, the security configuration of the app should be reviewed and updated, and security guides and recommendations for the infrastructure should be followed.

- Vulnerable and Outdated Components
The app uses components that have known security flaws or have not been updated and can be used by attackers to enter or damage your system. To prevent this, components should be kept updated and patched, and those not used or needed should be removed.

- Identification and Authentication Failures
The app does not verify the identity of users well or does not authenticate them securely, and may allow someone to impersonate another or steal their credentials. To prevent this, robust and secure identification and authentication methods should be used, such as strong passwords, multi-factor, biometrics, etc.

- Sensitive Data Exposure
The app shows or shares data that should be private or secret, such as personal, financial information, etc. To prevent this, confidential data should be protected with encryption, anonymization, minimization, etc.

- Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
The app does not record or monitor what happens in it, or does not do so adequately, and may hinder the detection and response to security incidents. To prevent this, the activities and events of the system should be logged and monitored, and tools and alerts should be used to analyze them and act in case of anomalies or attacks.

- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
The app from receivE false or malicious requests that make it access internal or external resources or services that it should not, and that can cause damage or data leaks. To prevent this, the requests received by the app should be validated and filtered, and white or blacklists for the resources or services that can be accessed should be used.
